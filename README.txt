Inspired by the video on YouTube 
Titled: Times Tables, Mandelbrot and the Heart of Mathematics
By channel: Mathologer

Approach:
Tried to apply MVC design pattern in Project. Turned the shaped into an object.
Then had the view drawing onto a jpanel and then put that onto a Frame

The radius is fixed at 300 for now, but the table value and the number of points
around the circle can be changed using the sliders underneath the drawing.
